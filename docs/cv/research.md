# Professional Interests & Research

## Areas of Focus
My primary professional interest lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and user experience. I am deeply fascinated by how we can leverage large language models (LLMs) to create more intuitive, personalized, and efficient digital products. I actively follow research from institutions like OpenAI, Google AI, and Stanford's HAI.

## Recent Projects & Learning
- Developed a personal project using Genkit and Next.js to automate creative writing tasks.
- Completed a deep learning specialization on Coursera to strengthen my foundational knowledge of neural networks.
- Experimenting with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to build more accurate and context-aware AI assistants.

## Career Goals
I aim to work in a role where I can contribute to building cutting-edge AI-powered applications that solve real-world problems. I am particularly excited about opportunities in companies that are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with generative AI.
