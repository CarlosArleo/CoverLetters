BIOGRAPHY
Architect and urban researcher with over 15 years of international experience spanning Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas. My work integrates critical urban theory—particularly extended urbanisation and planetary urbanisation—with applied research in regenerative development and design. Skilled in crafting strategic sustainability initiatives that align with local context, stakeholder needs, and broader ecological goals, I bring a systems-thinking approach to urban transformation.

I specialise in data-driven spatial analysis (GIS, R), masterplanning, and the co-creation of participatory frameworks. My design leadership is grounded in both studio teaching and real-world practice, enabling me to lead complex urban and architectural projects from concept to strategic delivery. Whether guiding masterplanning fostering local stewardship through regenerative frameworks, I focus on unlocking place-based potential while ensuring social, ecological, and economic resilience.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Co-Founder – Atelier Terre  
Marrakesh, Morocco | 2020 – Present  

Co-founded Atelier Terre, a regenerative design initiative dedicated to reviving traditional construction knowledge, supporting local artisans, and building circular rural economies in and around Marrakesh. The initiative merges architecture, ecological design, and social enterprise to empower small producers and preserve cultural landscapes.  

Mission & Focus:  
Empowering Local Artisans & Material Producers: Collaborated with regional crafts people and small-scale producers of earth-based materials, clay bricks, lime plasters, and hand-carved timber. Provided design support, co-developed fabrication protocols, and enhanced visibility of artisanal techniques within regenerative frameworks.  
Revitalising Vernacular Construction: Researched and re-applied traditional Moroccan building systems (e.g., pisé, tadelakt, and timber joinery) through contemporary regenerative principles—maximizing thermal performance, material circularity, and place-embedded identity.  
Circular Economy Integration: Developed a working framework informed by UKGBC Circular Economy Metrics, adapted for rural contexts. Focused on material reuse and on-site sourcing, design for disassembly and longevity, local production loops that minimize waste and reduce embodied carbon.  
Systems-Based Prototyping: Designed and built modular housing prototypes and public space elements (e.g., shade structures, seating, ovens) that integrate natural materials, passive strategies, and local knowledge. Projects served as training sites for young apprentices and knowledge transfer platforms.  
Socio-Economic Development: Connected artisan cooperatives with architects, NGOs, and regional stakeholders to create new market channels and long-term livelihoods. Promoted place-based entrepreneurship grounded in regenerative value creation, not extraction.  

Outcomes:  
Established a replicable village-scale regeneration model rooted in material sovereignty, cultural expression, and ecological balance.  
Created built prototypes and design packages demonstrating how craft and regeneration intersect to support climate resilience and rural continuity.  
Contributed to dialogues on decentralized sustainability practices, artisan agency, and non-extractive design economies in North Africa.

RESEARCH PROJECT

Translocalism’s Paradox: Interpreting Extended Urbanisation through Regenerative Development and Design (tentative)
Case Study Site: The Policy Framework and Land Allocation in Neoliberal Great Manchester Understanding the New Carrington Allocation, Trafford, Manchester – and its Impact on Environmental Preservation and Housing Crisis

Abstract
Investigating the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) and its response to the local housing crisis in the UK reveals a narrative that transcends regional strategies. The proposed site allocations for the green belt illustrate the tension between environmental preservation and urban restructuring. In this context, the hypothesis about the processes of transformation and planetary urbanisation (Henri Lefebvre, The Urban Revolution) is still relevant today, as we have urbanistic models of advanced capitalism that replicate homogenised and fragmented urban systems (Brenner and Schmid, 2012). In this field, land allocations within urban restructuring operations, through specific devices and protocols (accredited by plans, regulations, and policies), have effectively contributed to unsustainable development, promoting abstract and instrumental spaces for the reproduction of social relations (Christophers, 2018). These dynamics expose the materialisation of power in the built environment at a planetary scale that is inextricably linked to housing (Marcuse and Madden, 2016). The research will investigate the intersectional nature of labour in shaping both the natural world and society, which is always in flux and in constant reproduction; its performative nature, which has a presumed universality but in fact must be considered and deconstructed through the axes of power relations, which result in historically and geographically specific practices that shape our environment (Smith, 1990). The research highlights localities as crucial arenas for various struggles involving public democratic participation, environmental justice, labour organising, and housing rights movements. Ultimately, the research hypotheses the need for Regenerative Development and design-oriented policies (Reed, 2016; Lyle, 1996) that recognise the paradigm of “extended urbanisation” (Schmid, 2014), as a lens to view the complexities beyond localised urban restructuring strategies and their impacts on social dynamics, housing, and the environment in a larger context.
